Esquire
=======

Esquire is a light weight script loader and injection framework for JavaScript.

It is similar in conecpt to _RequireJS_ but with a few twists:

* Module loading, definition and instantiation is completely separate.
* Many instances of the same injector can be used, module instances will be
  kept separate.
* It [plays nicely](https://github.com/usrz/javascript-karma-esquire) with
  [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) for testing.
